# Property (SEMAT)

Our team is currently in the *"Collaborating"* state. We fulfil all of the requirements of the previous states in the 
checklist and the current one. For the current state, we achieve the requirements in the following ways: 
We work as one cohesive unit, by helping each other with debugging code when needed. 
Communication is open and honest, we share our struggles in our communication channels, 
and ask for help when needed. We are focused on completing the assignment, with the P+ grade, 
in which we have mostly succeeded, which is our mission. We also know each other well enough to trust 
that everyone will do their part. We have also achieved the first three requirements for the *”Performing”* state, 
but we still have a bit to go regarding the last two. For this assignment, we have had a backlog lingering for 
most of the assignment, so there are improvements to be made here, for example by starting our working 
process a bit earlier. Regarding the wasted work, we still need to improve our skills to identify wasted work, 
and eliminate it. We’ll try to establish blocking parts earlier, and try to not do double work by communicating 
and dividing the work better for the next assignment.
